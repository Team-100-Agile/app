      <img src="/snek.jpg" alt="snakes" class="smaller-image">
      <p>While Italy offers a wealth of natural beauty and captivating experiences, it's essential to be aware of potential hazards, including the presence of some dangerous snake species. Although encounters with venomous snakes are relatively rare, certain regions, particularly in the southern parts of the country, are home to species like the European adder (Vipera berus) and the nose-horned viper (Vipera ammodytes). These snakes are generally shy and tend to avoid humans, but it's prudent to exercise caution when exploring rural or wooded areas, especially during warmer months when they might be more active.</p>

      <p>Although direct interactions with these bears are quite rare, certain regions, particularly in the northern parts of the country such as the Apennine Mountains, are home to the Italian brown bear (Ursus arctos marsicanus). These bears are naturally reclusive and tend to avoid human contact. However, when venturing into remote or wooded areas, especially in their habitats, it's wise to exercise caution. Staying on established paths, making noise to alert bears of your presence, and carrying bear bells can help reduce the chances of unexpected encounters. </p>

It's advisable to exercise caution when traveling through flood-prone areas, especially during the rainy seasons or when weather conditions are unstable.</p>

    <h1>Earthquakes</h1>
        <img src="/earthquakeItaly.jpg" alt="earthquake" class="smaller-image">
      <p> Italy is situated in a seismically active area, and certain regions, particularly along the Apennine fault system and around the Adriatic Sea, are more susceptible to earthquakes. Although major seismic events are infrequent, it's prudent to be prepared and informed. When visiting earthquake-prone areas, consider familiarizing yourself with local emergency procedures and evacuation routes. Booking accommodations that adhere to seismic safety standards can provide added peace of mind. In the unlikely event of an earthquake, remember to "Drop, Cover, and Hold On" during the shaking, and once it subsides, follow the guidance of local authorities and be cautious of potential aftershocks.<a href="https://team-100-agile.github.io/earthquake/">Click here to go through an example scenario</a></p>

        <h3>Tourist Precautions</h3>
        <h1>Directions on narrow and steep walkways</h1>
      <img src="/ItalyWalkways.jpg" alt="Directions on narrow and steep walkways" class="smaller-image">
      <p>Navigating the charming and intricate pathways of Italy's towns and cities can be an enchanting experience, but it's essential to navigate with caution and adaptability. While technology like Google Maps can be a helpful tool, it's wise not to rely solely on it for navigation. The narrow alleyways, ancient streets, and cobblestone pathways can often deviate from the digital map, leading to confusion and getting lost. Moreover, the presence of inclined slopes and occasional obstacles can make walking routes less straightforward. To fully immerse yourself in the authentic atmosphere and avoid unnecessary stress, consider supplementing digital navigation with a physical map, asking locals for directions, and embracing the adventure of discovering hidden gems through exploration.
